Hi, I'm Judith, a PhD student at the University of Tuebingen. 

One of my research topics is on metagenomics, the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. 
The main focus of my research is on the analysis of the oral metagenome of ancient individuals. This offers a deeper 
insight into the microbial community, which inhabits the human oral cavity. 
My current project is concerned with ancient mummies from middle Egypt, with the main focus on the bacterial composition 
of the oral cavity. The aim of this project is to get a more detailed understanding how the oral metagenome evolved. 
Moreover, ancient samples also offers a great opportunity to investigate pathogens that are contained in the 
samples.
  

Another focus of my research is on the analysis of human mitochondrial DNA that is mainly used in population genetics. 
This project includes the development of a mitochondrial workbench, with a main focus on easy file handling and conversion. 
Moreover, it offers the functionality to combine, manipulate and visualize mitochondrial data. It also provides tools 
for basic downstream analyses, e.g. PCA, Fst and Haplogroup determination.
