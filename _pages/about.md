Hi, I'm Judith, a PhD student at the [Institute of Evolutionary Medicine](http://www.iem.uzh.ch/en/research/researchgroups/ancientbiomoleculargroup.html) 
at the University of Zurich. 

I'm working on metagenomic analysis, the investigation of genetic material obtained directly from samples without applying 
any capturing or enrichment methods. My research focuses on the analysis of the ancient oral metagenome, which provides 
a deeper insight into the microbial community that inhabits the human oral cavity. 
My current project deals with ancient mummies from Middle Egypt, with a focus on the bacterial composition of the oral 
cavity, but also how the bacterial composition differs considering different sample tissues. In addition, antique samples 
also offer a good opportunity to investigate pathogens contained in the samples.
  

Another focus of my research is the analysis of human mitochondrial DNA, which is often used in population genetics. 
This project involves the development of a mitochondrial workbench with a focus on the easy handling and conversion of files. 
Furthermore, it offers the possibility to combine, manipulate and visualize mitochondrial data. It also provides tools 
for basic downstream analysis, e.g. PCA, Fst and haplogroup determination. 

I began my studies in Tuebingen, where I received my BSc and MSc degrees in Bioinformatics, while also studying abroad 
at the University of Uppsala during my Masters.
