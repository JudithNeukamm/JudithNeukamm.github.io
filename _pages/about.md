Hi, I'm Judith, a PhD student in Bioinformatics at the [Institute of Evolutionary Medicine](http://www.iem.uzh.ch/en/research/researchgroups/ancientbiomoleculargroup.html) 
at the University of Zurich. 

My research focuses on the analysis of the ancient metagenome, the investigation of genetic material obtained directly 
from samples without applying any capturing or enrichment methods. I'm interested in the ancient oral metagenome in 
particular, which provides a deeper insight into the microbial community that inhabits the human oral cavity. This 
work also covers the study of ancient pathogens and viruses, e.g. Mycobacterium leprae, especially how they have evolved and migrated.
  
Another focus of my research is the analysis of human mitochondrial DNA, which is often used in population genetics. 
This project involves the development of a mitochondrial workbench with a focus on the easy handling and conversion of files. 
Furthermore, it offers the possibility to combine, manipulate and visualize mitochondrial data. It also provides basic 
downstream analysis, e.g. PCA, FST and haplogroup determination. This workbench also provides access to a database containing
public complete human mitochondrial genomes including metainformation.

I began my studies in Tuebingen, where I received my BSc and MSc degrees in Bioinformatics, while also studying abroad 
at the University of Uppsala during my Masters.
